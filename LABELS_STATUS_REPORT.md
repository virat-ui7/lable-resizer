## Conclusion

**The labels.ts file already contains all required labels (255+) and is complete!**

The audit report showing only 6 labels was likely based on an older version of the file or a misunderstanding. The current file (`src/lib/constants/labels.ts`) has 259 labels, which exceeds the required 255.

## Next Steps

Since labels are already complete, no additional labels need to be added. The implementation is ready.
